# 📌 Introduction to UV

**UV** is a cutting-edge Python packaging and dependency management tool that has been designed to replace **pip**. UV offers a more efficient, modern approach to managing Python packages, providing enhanced performance and better handling of dependencies. With UV, developers can streamline their workflows, optimize package installations, and ensure cleaner and more reliable environments.

While `pip` has been the go-to tool for Python packaging for years, UV introduces several improvements that address common issues such as dependency resolution conflicts, slower installation times, and limited virtual environment management capabilities. UV is built with performance and security in mind, making it a highly reliable tool for both simple projects and complex workflows.

### Key Enhancements Over Pip

- **Speed**: UV is optimized for faster package installation and resolution, reducing the time spent on setting up environments and installing dependencies.
- **Improved Dependency Resolution**: UV uses a more sophisticated algorithm to resolve dependencies, minimizing the chance of version conflicts and ensuring a smoother installation process.
- **Built-in Virtual Environment Management**: Unlike pip, which requires external tools like `virtualenv`, UV offers built-in support for creating and managing virtual environments.
- **Automatic Compatibility Checks**: UV ensures that your Python version is compatible with the installed packages and dependencies, minimizing compatibility issues.
- **Streamlined User Interface**: UV features a simplified command structure that makes it easier to manage Python environments and packages directly from the command line.

### Why Switch to UV?

- **Faster Installations**: UV dramatically reduces installation times, especially for large projects with many dependencies.
- **Automatic Dependency Resolution**: UV resolves dependencies in a more intelligent way, preventing common issues like version mismatches.
- **Simpler Workflows**: With UV, you can eliminate the need for multiple external tools and manage everything from one unified command-line interface.
- **Better Package Integrity**: UV performs more rigorous checks for package integrity, ensuring that the packages you install are secure and compatible.

## Highlights

- 🚀 A single tool to replace `pip`, `pip-tools`, `pipx`, `poetry`, `pyenv`, `twine`, `virtualenv`,
  and more.
- ⚡️ 10-100x faster than `pip`.
- 🗂️ Provides [comprehensive project management](#projects), with a
  [universal lockfile](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/layout#the-lockfile).
- ❇️ [Runs scripts](#scripts), with support for
  [inline dependency metadata](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts#declaring-script-dependencies).
- 🐍 [Installs and manages](#python-versions) Python versions.
- 🛠️ [Runs and installs](#tools) tools published as Python packages.
- 🔩 Includes a [pip-compatible interface](#the-pip-interface) for a performance boost with a
  familiar CLI.
- 🏢 Supports Cargo-style workspaces for
  scalable projects.
- 💾 Disk-space efficient, with a global cache for
  dependency deduplication.
- ⏬ Installable without Rust or Python via `curl` or `pip`.
- 🖥️ Supports macOS, Linux, and Windows.


## How to Create UV Project in VS Code

    uv version

    uv help

    uv init --package explore-uv

This command sets up a project structured for packaging, placing your code inside a src directory, aligning with best practices for Python project structures.

    cd explore-uv

    code .

Use code . on terminal or open the directory explore-uv in VSCode

Now Create Virtual environment:

    uv venv

Activate virtual environment:

    source .venv/bin/activate

    In Windows 
    \explore-uv\.venv\Scripts\activate

Select Recommended Python Interpreter (./.venv/bin/python) created by virtual envirnoment in VSCode

    uv run explore-uv

## 📁 Repo Structure
